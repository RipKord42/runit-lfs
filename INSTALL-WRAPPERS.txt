INSTALLING REBOOT/SHUTDOWN WRAPPERS
====================================

If your LFS system doesn't have reboot/shutdown/halt/poweroff commands
(because sysvinit versions were removed), install these wrapper scripts:

sudo install -m755 reboot-wrapper.sh /sbin/reboot
sudo install -m755 halt-wrapper.sh /sbin/halt
sudo install -m755 poweroff-wrapper.sh /sbin/poweroff
sudo install -m755 shutdown-wrapper.sh /sbin/shutdown

These scripts will:
- Set the appropriate control file in /run/runit/
- Signal runit (PID 1) to initiate shutdown

USAGE:
------
reboot          - Reboot the system
halt            - Halt the system
poweroff        - Power off the system
shutdown -r now - Reboot
shutdown -h now - Halt

NOTE: The shutdown wrapper is basic and doesn't support all sysvinit
shutdown options (like delayed shutdown). For full functionality,
consider installing sysvinit's shutdown tools or using the runit
signal method directly:

  kill -s INT 1    # reboot
  kill -s TERM 1   # halt
